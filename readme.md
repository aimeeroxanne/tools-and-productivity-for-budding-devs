## Tools & Productivity for Budding Developers  

This is a (mostly) self paced workshop to get your machine ready to start coding. We'll cover the must haves, as well as some extra curricular's to boost your productivity and get you using your machine like a developer. The goal for tonight is to leave here with a comprehensive checklist for setting up your development environment.  

#### *Keep in mind, this is not a one size fits all class.*

We all use different hardware, operating systems and technologies. The below list tailored to mac OSX users, and budding JavaScript developers, but we will get your computer set up no matter what you're working with!  

This may be totally foreign to you, or already part of your wheelhouse. Either way, you will build your own guide to setting up your environment. 

#### **Some advice to you, my friend...**

Take notes! Wherever that may be, commit to a system and stick to it. You know how YOU think. Set your future self up for success by taking notes in whatever for is most helpful to you. 

Google is your friend. If you don't know what something on this list is, google it. Read about it. Formulate a definition of what it is. Then ask clarifying questions.
