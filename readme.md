### Tools & Productivity for Budding Developers  

This is a (mostly) self paced workshop to get your machine ready to start coding. We'll cover the must haves, as well as some extra curricular's to boost your productivity and get you using your machine like a developer. The goal for tonight is to leave here with a comprehensive checklist for setting up your development environment.  

*Keep in mind, this is not a one size fits all class.*

We all use different hardware, operating systems and technologies. The below list tailored to mac OSX users, and budding JavaScript developers, but we will get your computer set up no matter what you're working with!  

This may be totally foreign to you, or already part of your wheelhouse. Either way, you will build your own guide to setting up your environment.
